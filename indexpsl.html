<br><br>
				Since its inception in 2015, the Pakistan Super League (PSL) has quickly become one of the most popular professional cricket leagues in the world. The league was founded by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) with the goal of improving the quality of cricket in Pakistan and to create a more stable environment for professional players. The PSL is a single entity in which each franchise is owned and controlled by investors. This eliminates the possibility of teams folding or being sold off, which has been a problem with other cricket leagues in Pakistan. The league is a double round robin format in which the top four teams with the most points qualify for the playoffs. The playoffs culminate in the final, which is the most-viewed cricket match in Pakistan. The PSL has quickly become a major stage for international stars to compete in. In its first year, the PSL hosted several international matches, including a match between the Pakistan cricket team and the West Indies cricket team. Since then, the PSL has hosted tournaments featuring teams from all over the world, including the Pakistan Super League2017 Champions, the Royal Challengers Bangalore from India, and the Melbourne Stars from Australia. The PSL is a major step forward for cricket in Pakistan and has quickly become one of the most popular professional cricket leagues in the world.
				<br><br>
The PSL is a single entity in which each franchise is owned and controlled by investors. The PSL is a competition between the top teams in Pakistan and is a way for these teams to qualify for the lucrative ICC World Twenty20 tournament. The PSL began in 2015 with five teams and has increased in size every year. The league culminates with the final which is usually played in the same city as the Pakistan cricket team's international matches.
				<br><br>
 Instead of operating as an association of independently-owned teams, the league is a single entity in which each franchise is owned and controlled by investors. Each team plays the group stage matches in a double round robin format; the top four teams with the most points qualify for the playoffs. The league culminates in the final.

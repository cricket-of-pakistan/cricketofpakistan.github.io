           <b> Why Cricket Is The National Game Of Pakistan </b> <br> <br>

Cricket is not just a game in Pakistan; it is a way of life. From the streets to the stadiums,
<b> cricket fever</b> grips the nation every time a match is played. The game has a long and rich 
history in Pakistan, dating back to the days of British rule. It was introduced to the country 
by British soldiers and quickly became popular among the locals. Cricket remained a popular 
sport even after Pakistan gained independence from Britain in 1947. <b> The country’s first cricket 
team was formed in 1948 and Pakistan became a member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) 
in 1952.</b> The game has since gone on to become the <b> national sport of Pakistan,</b> with millions of 
fans across the country. Cricket is more than just a <b> sport in Pakistan;</b> it is a passion that 
unites people from all walks of life. <br> <br>

<b>What is cricket? </b> <br><br>

Cricket is a <b> bat-and-ball game </b> played between two teams of eleven players each on a cricket 
field, at the centre of which is a rectangular <b>22-yard-long pitch.</b> The game is played by  <b> 120 
million people in many countries, </b> making it the world's second most popular sport  after 
football. <br> <br>

Each team takes its turn to bat, attempting to score as many runs as possible while the other 
team bowls and fields, trying to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen. When each team 
has batted an equal number of times, the teams have completed one innings each and the match 
enters its second phase: either one team needs to score more runs than their opponents in their 
final innings to win, or both teams need to score the same number of runs in their final 
innings so that the outcome is decided by a preceding period of play called a Super Over.
<br><br>

The winner of the match is the team that scores more runs in their final innings, or if both 
teams have scored exactly the same number of runs over both innings, then whichever team has 
scored more boundaries (four or six hits) during the course of the match wins.
<br><br>

				Street cricket is a popular pastime in Pakistan, and many young people see it as an opportunity to escape the poverty and violence of their everyday lives. The game is played with a tennis ball and a makeshift bat, and usually takes place in narrow alleyways between buildings. Although there are no formal rules, the game is fiercely contested and often violent. Batsmen have been known to be attacked by bowlers and fielders, and even killed. In this blog post, we will explore the phenomenon of street cricket in Pakistan, its dangers, and its appeal.
				<br><br>

				<b class=" text-2xl">Street Cricket</b> 
				<br><br>
				Street cricket is a popular sport in Pakistan, played by both boys and girls. It is a game that can be enjoyed by all, regardless of skill level. All you need is a bat, ball and a group of friends.
				<br><br>
				Street cricket is typically played on concrete, with makeshift stumps drawn on the ground. The pitch can be as long or short as you like, and there are no boundaries. This makes the game very fast paced and exciting.
				<br><br>
				There are no set rules to street cricket, which means that each game is unique. This also makes the game more challenging, as players must think on their feet and adapt to the situation.
				<br><br>
				Although street cricket is not as formal as other sports, it is still a great way to stay fit and active. It requires quick reflexes and good hand-eye coordination. Street cricket is also a great social activity, allowing you to meet new people and make new friends.
				<br><br>
				<b class=" text-2xl">Street Cricket in Pakistan</b> 
				<br><br>
				Street Cricket in Pakistan is a popular game played by children and young adults in the streets of Pakistani cities. The game is played with a small, hard ball and a bat made of wood or plastic. The players divide into two teams, with each team having six to ten players. One player from each team bats, while the rest of the team fields. The batting team tries to score runs by hitting the ball with their bat and running between the wickets, while the fielding team tries to stop them from scoring by catching the ball or getting it close to one of the stumps (wickets).
				<br><br>
				The game is simple but can be very exciting, as it requires both skill and luck. Street Cricket is a great way for children to stay active and have fun. It is also a good way for them to socialize and make new friends.
